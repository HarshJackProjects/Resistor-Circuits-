# Resistor-Circuits-
Shows color coder for resistor values. The first input takes in the first number of the resistor. The Second number takes in the second resistor value and the third inout is the resistor multiplier number. Which will show the resistance color code that corosponds to the entered value. 

# To Do
- to change the multiplier input automatically based on the initial number entered. 
- have the app show color code with visual changes.
